# Course: Financial Frictions, Monetary and Macroprudential Policy and Household Heterogeneity

This course is written for the EUI Econ PhD students as an advancened half-credit course. 

In a nutshell:

:round_pushpin: Gives an introduction to DSGE models and their solution with the [Dynare](https://www.dynare.org) package

:round_pushpin: Studies the incorporation of financial frictions in DSGE models 

:round_pushpin: The use of DSGE models for the design of monetary policy and financial regulation

:round_pushpin: Extends modelling framework to household heterogeneity and studies the impact of monetary policy

## Day 1: DSGE model overerview, the RBC model & Dynare introduction

During the first lecture we will go thorugh a short introduction on DSGE models and their various solution techniques. 
Then we will set up the very simple RBC model and learn how to use Dynare to solve it (get the policy functions).
This is of hight importance as we will go through much more complicated models in the next lectures
